# rent-vs-buy
compare the gains/opportunity costs of renting a house/apartment vs buying it. 

./unrecoverable-costs-comparison directory
initially, I tried comparing the monthly unrecoverable costs of each. 
this includes Ben Felix's suugestion of how to calculate unrecoverable costs, as well as an alternate approach from a reditters critique of the method

./long-term-gains-comparison
now, I am looking to compare the long term values of renting vs buying.
