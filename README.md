# rent-vs-buy
compare the gains/opportunity costs of renting a house/apartment vs buying it. 

initially, I tried comparing the monthly unrecoverable costs of each; see unrecoverable-costs-comparison directory. 
however this approach has too many unaccounted variables. 

now, I am looking to compare the long term values of renting vs buying.
